# RuPaul's Drag Race Simulator
A simulator for the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race, made with Typescript and HTML.

## How does it work?
For a short description, every contestant has seven mains skills (Acting, Comedy, Dance, Design, Improv, Runway and Lip-Sync). Challenges and other occurences will use these skills to determine with more accuracy how each contestant does in a specific challenge, although there's still a random element to it.
